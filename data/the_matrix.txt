Neo is contacted by Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), a beautiful stranger who leads him into an underworld where he meets Morpheus. They fight a brutal battle for their lives against a cadre of viciously intelligent secret agents. It is a truth that could cost Neo something more precious than his life.

Though The Matrix ultimately overdoses on gloom-and-doom grunge, over-elaborate cool and especially running time, it's just clever enough to enable [the Wachowskis] to nix the sophomore jinx following 1996's Bound.

I know almost nothing of the intricate techniques that make The Matrix as eye-filling as it is brain-numbing, but I can tell you that... [its visuals] are wondrous to behold.

There's more form than content in The Matrix, but Bill Pope's swooping, noir-inflected cinematography is wonderfully complemented by Owen Paterson's inventive production design, a great soundtrack and the best fight choreography this side of Hong Kong.

The Wachowskis proceed to turn the world as we know it into a virtual reality landscape with a 20th century tech-noir look (lit with a sickly green hue, like the glow of an old IBM computer screen) and the physics of a video game.

A cyberpunk thriller that's so much fun to watch, it could single-handedly reboot the genre.

So good that you entirely forget the nutty premise that we're all being kept in suspended animation wired into some kind of giant mainframe which creates more energy than it requires. Oh well, whatever. Great adventure story.

The review
The Matrix is one of the most ambitious and captivating Sci-Fi films of all time. The action is electric, the characters are strong and there are legendary moments peppered throughout. Where the film is lacking is in the actual human aspect; the romance is underdeveloped and Neo's life in the Matrix is superficial (why do we need a scene of his boss disciplining him?). That being said, the fight sequences are incredibly entertaining and the entire idea of the Matrix plays with your mind. I honestly fell asleep multiple times watching the film and had to go back and watch it again. From the slow motion to the muted colors, it was easy to doze off. However, once the climactic moments hit, I was enthralled. The helicopter scene is great and the final fight sequences hit hard. I'm curious where the franchise will go from here, but this film is a brilliant start. Best Character: Tank Best Quote: "There's a difference between knowing the path and walking the path." - Morpheus Best Scene: The Bullet Dodge Best Piece of Score: "He's the One Alright"
